# MDN article layout recreation

This layout is a recreation of the MDN articles' layout. I created it to practice core web technologies: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

* The original layout, which this one is based on, can be found in any article on [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/).

* I recreated the layout by observing the original and aiming for a similar visual output, writing my own code from scratch without looking at the original source code.

* I replaced all [logos, trademarks, service marks, wordmarks, and non-free icons](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/MDN/Writing_guidelines/Attrib_copyright_license#logos_trademarks_service_marks_and_wordmarks) with [ionicons](https://ionic.io/ionicons)
